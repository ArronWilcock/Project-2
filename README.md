# Project-2

1. On the mockup for the accomodation cards the first card when in mobile view has a different font weight to the others. Is this needed for the project or is this an
error on the mockup?

2. should the search button in the search bar be reacting in anyway on click for this project?

3. In the Activities cards in the bottom corners where the caption covers the image there is a dark line as if the image is showing slightly more than the caption.
I haven't been able to figure this out yet so if you are able to talk me through the issue that would be appreciated.

4. In mobile view are the filters i have acceptable as i feel that they are a bit smaller than the mockup but am hesitant to start playing with these sizes again so
close to presentation?
